    1.1 for all state generate all the possible states (do iterations based on the difficulty of the game)
  2. push all states into a list(maybe 2d list with level and state in it)(push infront)
  3. do hueristic function that calculate how far the state from goal 
  4. from the bottom of the list (mentioned in number 2) (acess states from bottom level), calculate 
     hueristic value for each state at the bottom.
